MyFlappyBirdGame

I leave available the google drive link that contains this first version of my first game:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IMCN7h8Vzg_5DWiKmdm1XwxTmRmDiNyZ?usp=share_link

In this game we use a bird to traverse pipes using the Space Bar.
Im create this game with C# and Unity tools and utilities.

#In future versions we will have more gameplay such as the possibility of shooting enemies that appear on the scene, among other things.
